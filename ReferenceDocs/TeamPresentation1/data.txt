Project - Cart Builder, placeholder name

Project Overview - The app will contain a database of searchable recipes selected from the Recipe1M JSON dataset. Users will be able to select these recipes and 
add them to a shopping list staging area. The staging area populates with the ingredients needed for said recipes at their desired serving sizes. User can 
enter how much of the ingredient they already have, then print out a shopping list of ingredients needed to make their meals. 

Target audience - Any busy individual that does the grocery shopping for their family and needs a quick and painless way to plan their trip to the store. 

Front-end framework - React.js will be used to render the application, enhanced with Bootstrap components. JavaScript will be used to make the xmlhttprequests with the api tier. A color scheme and logo will be decided at a later date. 
At various points in the project, we will need to use a template engine. This decision is still being researched, but Jinja2 is one of the possibilities. 



Back-end framework - TODO::

Other: we expect to host the application on the AWS free tier. We have an already established DNS namespace that we can issue a cert for.
